# TypeORM Performance

## Save vs Upsert

### Guidelines
- ❌ Avoid using `save` for bulk operations
- ✅ Use `upsert` for bulk operations
- `save` generates multiple queries (100+ for 100 entities)
- `upsert` uses single query for bulk operations

## Performance Best Practices
- ✅ Use `upsert` for bulk operations instead of `save`
- ✅ Avoid N+1 queries by using proper relations
- ✅ Use query builders for complex queries
- ✅ Consider using raw queries for performance-critical operations
- ✅ Use database indexes appropriately
- ✅ Monitor query performance in development
