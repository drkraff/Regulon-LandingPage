# Logging Standards

## Log Message Guidelines
- ✅ Use unique log messages to trace back to specific code
- ✅ Log messages should always be constant strings with structured parameters
  ```typescript
  // Good
  log.debug('Starting scan', { scanId })
  
  // Bad
  log.debug(`Starting scan ${scanId}`)
  ```
- ✅ Always provide context in logs
- ✅ Log main object IDs and container sizes
- ❌ Never log sensitive information

## Logging Points
- ✅ Log entry points of scripts & tasks (except microservice endpoints)
- ✅ Log failures when exceptions aren't thrown
- ✅ Log feature flag behavior
- ✅ Log special cases with early returns
- ✅ Acceptable to log for performance and statistics

## Core Rules
1. ✅ Use unique log messages
2. ✅ Log important scenarios:
   - Script/task entry points
   - Action failures (when no exception thrown)
   - Feature flag state changes
   - Special case early returns
3. ✅ Provide context
   ```typescript
   // Good
   'Could not reach verify-py microservice, marking every file classification as not verified and datascan verification step as failed'
   
   // Bad
   'Could not verify file classifications'
   ```
4. ✅ Log useful data:
   - Main object IDs
   - Container sizes
5. ✅ Log for:
   - Performance
   - Statistics
6. ❌ Never log sensitive information
